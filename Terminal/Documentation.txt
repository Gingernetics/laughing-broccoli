Terminal Documentation

This project is designed to emmulate terminal capabilities within a Java environment

Commands can only be supported in this system if their executable can be found in /bin

Supported bash commands:
    echo
    mkdir
    pwd
    cat (Sort of, separate lines)
    ls (Sort of, separate lines)
    rm (-r)
    java 
    javac


Abstract Data Type: Queue
    **Will be** Used to implement a history command specific to input through 
this java terminal, rather than the bash terminal history

Limitations:
    Fails to bring up appropriate error message
        -Missing Operands, or too many arguments, 
        -Removing a non-empty directory without using -r argument
    Files must be in current working directory (cd is not available)
    
**Check if classpaths work
